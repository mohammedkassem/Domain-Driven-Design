# Domain Driven Design


### FLow ###
  * Application Layer will Start the Use Case ( Purchasing )
  * Instantiate the Actor who is gonna start the use Case ( Purchaser )
  * Instantiate the Actor in a valid State ( Please give him an empty Cart )
    * ``` Customer = new Customer(new Cart()) ```
  * Use Specifications and Domain Services to drive the flow 
    * DidTheCsutomerPurchasedMoreThanThreeItems ( Specefication )
    * TaxCalculater ( Service )
  * Domain Service argument's and return's must be a Domain Objects
  * Dispatch Domain Events and Give the flow control back to the Application Layer
  * End the Use Case
